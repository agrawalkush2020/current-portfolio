    <h2 class = "h2about">   Hobbies and Interests </h2>
    <p>
        My hobbies are playing outdoor games and going to gym. I am fitness 
        freak and love to do physical exercises. I take pleasure in listening to 
        music. I never really thought that this was my hobby, but I’m beginning 
        to comprehend that it is.

    <h2 class = "h2about" >   My Strength </h2>
    <p>
        My strength is that I am always ready to take up the challenges and 
        strive for excellence. My thinking suggests that accepting both success 
        and failures can only lead one to reach our goal. I do not like to say 
        weaknesses, but I want to say that I will not leave any question 
        altogether, I believe in myself and my hard work, and I want fulfilment 
        in everything.
    </p>

        is to be startup Big Technology Company like Microsoft ,Google , and 
        Facebook ,etc. My philosophy is "I always love to take challenges for my 
        progress and steady growth".
